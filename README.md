Basic Number Guess console application to get started with C#

## About

This console application is my first C# project.  I followed along with the tutorial from [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcFJjpMFJvI)
and added some other code to clean it up.

I also went through [Derek Banas's C# Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lisiwUZJXqQ) to get an overview of C#
and the .NET Framework.

Another helpful resource was from [Programming With Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY)

As I continue to learn more about C#, I will continue to make more C# programs for practice.  My goal is to get into
ASP.NET development as soon as possible.
